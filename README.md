# LuaDemon
A universal script host with hotloading capabilites for Lua.
Compiles using C++ 11.

Developed for Linux (g++) and Windows (Visual Studio 2017)
Runs on x86, x64, and ARM.

LuaDemon is able to reload the Lua runtime on the fly without having to restart any processes or resetting any global Lua data.
This is tested under Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.

Note: I do not claim any ownership of Lua, LuaJIT or their binaries.
